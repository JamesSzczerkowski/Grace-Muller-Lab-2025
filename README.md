# Grace-Muller-Lab-2025
This repository provides code for signal processing tasks, specifically focusing on signal edge detection and masking techniques. Process raw signals to identify edges (e.g., rising or falling edges). Apply masking algorithms to isolate regions of interest and suppress noise. Visualize signal transitions and masked areas for better analysis.
